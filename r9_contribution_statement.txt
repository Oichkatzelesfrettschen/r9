R9 contributes to operating systems research by demonstrating a Rust-based, multi-architecture kernel engineered for enhanced safety and verifiability. It provides a practical testbed for applying formal verification techniques to core OS components, exemplified by plans to verify its memory allocator. Through its minimal and transparent design across x86_64, aarch64, and riscv64, R9 also serves as an effective educational tool for low-level systems concepts and offers a potential foundation for secure, specialized kernels in high-assurance environments.
